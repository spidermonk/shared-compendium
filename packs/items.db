Once the spell ends, the tattoo vanishes from your skin.</p>\n<p>The level of the spell in the tattoo determines the spell’s saving throw DC, attack bonus, spellcasting ability modifier, and the tattoo’s rarity, as shown in the Spellwrought Tattoo table.</p>\n<h5>Spellwrought Tattoo</h5>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Spell <br />Level</th>\n<th><br />Rarity</th>\n<th>Spellcasting <br />Ability Mod.</th>\n<th>Save <br />DC</th>\n<th>Attack <br />Bonus</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cantrip</td>\n<td>Common</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>Common</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>Uncommon</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>Uncommon</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>Rare</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>+7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>Rare</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>+9</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h5 id=\"MagicTattooCoverageTable\">Magic Tattoo Coverage</h5>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tattoo Rarity</th>\n<th>Area Covered</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Common</td>\n<td>One hand or foot or a quarter of a limb</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uncommon</td>\n<td>Half a limb or the scalp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rare</td>\n<td>One limb</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Very Rare</td>\n<td>Two limbs or the chest or upper back</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Legendary</td>\n<td>Two limbs and the torso</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 135","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Common","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"properties":{"mgc":true}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CW6aaPVQ98g3BJ67":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","filterType":"Wondrous item","tags":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":67,"pageNumber":135,"sourceType":1}]},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":2408336,"originalName":"Spellwrought Tattoo, 1st level"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":0,"rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.ddb-atul-items.NPt3GwcC5S0ZuiBB"}},"_id":"JDp18fKEeSFcmxqt"}

While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.</p>\n<p>The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.</p>\n<p>A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.</p>\n<h3>Apparatus of the Crab Levers</h3>\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Lever</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Up</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Down</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim.</td>\n<td>Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Forward window shutter opens.</td>\n<td>Forward window shutter closes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Side window shutters open (two per side).</td>\n<td>Side window shutters close (two per side).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.</td>\n<td>The claws retract.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.</p>\n<p>When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.</p>\n<p>If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.</p>\n<p>A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.</p>","unidentified":"Rod"},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 195","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Very Rare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"properties":{"mgc":true}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CW6aaPVQ98g3BJ67":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Rod","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/18/885/636381749890460086.jpeg","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/7/386/636284765204637619.jpeg","filterType":"Rod","tags":["Utility","Warding"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":195,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://xcalibur-games-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/ddb-images/other/item-large-Rod-of-Absorption.jpeg"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":4744,"originalName":"Rod of Absorption"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":0,"rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":true,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.ddb-atul-items.LJcJTQ1ide4N4ZFL"}},"_id":"VM7yHTqoCEvvdHbJ"}

If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>\n<p>The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.</p>\n<p><strong>Serpentine Owl.</strong> This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours.

While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ensnarement.</strong></em> While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Containment.</strong></em> The first 10 pages of the <em>Demonomicon</em> are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the <em>Demonomicon’s</em> empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature’s widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p>When you finish a long rest, if you and the <em>Demonomicon</em> are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can’t try to possess you again for 7 days.</p>\n<p>When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Destroying the Demonomicon.</strong></em> To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book’s pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book’s remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, <em>Fraz-Urb’luu’s Staff</em>. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the <em>Tome of Zyx</em>, the work that served as the foundation for the <em>Demonomicon</em>. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb’luu instantly knows.</p>","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything pg 125","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":1,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Artifact","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"properties":{"mgc":true}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CW6aaPVQ98g3BJ67":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","avatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/415/637411376939831778.png","largeAvatarUrl":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/13904/416/637411376941228249.png","filterType":"Wondrous item","tags":[],"sources":[{"sourceId":67,"pageNumber":125,"sourceType":1}],"pictureUrl":"https://xcalibur-games-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/ddb-images/other/item-large-Demonomicon-of-Iggwilv.png"},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":2407504,"originalName":"Demonomicon of Iggwilv"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":0,"rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":true,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.ddb-atul-items.Rr1om4vraDVxI1Q4"}}}

Any creature inside an open <em>portable hole</em> can exit the hole by climbing out of it.</p>\n<p>You can use an action to close a <em>portable hole</em> by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.</p>\n<p>If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the <em>portable hole</em> or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed <em>portable hole</em> can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.</p>\n<p>Placing a <em>portable hole</em> inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.</p>","unidentified":"Wondrous item"},"source":"Basic Rules, Player's Handbook pg 185","quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"attuned":false,"attunement":0,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Rare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"armor":{"value":10,"type":"trinket","dex":null},"hp":{"value":0,"max":0,"dt":null,"conditions":""},"speed":{"value":null,"conditions":""},"strength":0,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"properties":{"mgc":true}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"CW6aaPVQ98g3BJ67":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"dndbeyond":{"type":"Wondrous item","filterType":"Wondrous item","tags":["Utility","Container"],"sources":[{"sourceId":1,"pageNumber":null,"sourceType":2},{"sourceId":2,"pageNumber":185,"sourceType":1}]},"id":0,"entityTypeId":0,"definitionEntityTypeId":112130694,"definitionId":4699,"originalName":"Portable Hole"},"magicitems":{"enabled":true,"charges":0,"chargeType":"c1","rechargeable":false,"recharge":0,"rechargeType":"t2","rechargeUnit":"","destroy":false,"destroyCheck":"d1","spells":{},"feats":{},"tables":{},"equipped":true,"attuned":false,"destroyFlavorText":"reaches 0 charges: it crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","sorting":"l"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.ddb-atul-items.ul3bXVNBhuB6UQBt"}},"_id":"os3xmvv3aiBXZ5xr"}
